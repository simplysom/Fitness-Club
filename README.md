In this world of digitalization, several choices are available to a person. Every decision a person makes consists of a lot of research. Therefore, institutes must show themselves better in the digital world. They must have something different which will attract customers towards them. 
Fitness Club is a website developed using php that shows all the information about the gym starting from the reasons why people should join the gym to the daily schedule followed in the gym. 
The website contains information about the different packages our gym has to offer,the equipment our gym has as well as the different trainers we have in our gym.We have also included a BMI calculator
